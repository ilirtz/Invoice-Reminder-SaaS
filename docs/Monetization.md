## 3️⃣ Payment Processing

### Phase 1 — Manual Payment (MVP)

- User registers
- Manual email → invite to pay via:
    - PayPal
    - Revolut
    - Stripe payment link
- Admin manually flags `is_paid_user = True` in DB

### Phase 2 — Automated Payment (Post-MVP)

- Integrate **Stripe Checkout**
- On successful payment:
    - Stripe webhook triggers → sets `is_paid_user = True`
    - Auto-upgrades user account
    - Automated subscription management
